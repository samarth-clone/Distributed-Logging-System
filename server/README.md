Before running the server, it is important to update the default username and password for security purposes. To change the username and password, follow these steps:

1. Open the server  `RR-Team-82-distributed-logging-system/server.go`.

2. Look for the section that specifies the username and password.

3. Change the credentials

4. Save the changes to the configuration file.

Once you have updated the username and password, you can proceed with running the server. This ensures that only authorized users can access the system and helps protect against unauthorized access.
